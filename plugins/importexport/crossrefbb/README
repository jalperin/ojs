About
-----
This plugin provides an import/export plugin to generate metadata information for articles 
and issues for indexing in CrossRef as well as registration of the metadata with CrossRef from within OJS. Details on the XML format and data requirements is available at: 
http://doi.crossref.org/schemas/common4.3.0.xsd

License
-------
This plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. See the file COPYING for the 
complete terms of this license.

System Requirements
-------------------
Same requirements as the OJS 2.4.x core.
Additionaly CURL library.

Installation
------------
To install the plugin:
 - copy the crossref folder into OJS/plugins/importexport

The export functionality can then be accessed through: 
 - Home > User > Journal Management > Import/Export Data > CrossRef XML Export Plugin

Localization
------------
Localized titles are determined from the per-article language setting, rather than the journal locale.  
As such, localized bibliographic data should be handled properly as per the CrossRef data format 
guidelines, however, it has not been explicitly tested as of this release.

Note
---------
In order to register DOIs with CrossRef from within OJS you will have to enter your username and password. 
If you do not enter or have your own username and password you'll still be able to export into the 
CrossRef XML format but you cannot register your DOIs from within OJS.
Please note, that the password will be saved as plain text, i.e. not encrypted, due to CrossRef registration service requirements.

Contact/Support
---------------
